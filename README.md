BuilderML is my first try with <b>ML</b>

The final goal is to make a generative AI which understands human text inputs
and builds it in minecraft (server-side only).

However I lack the huge amount of data it would need to make a quality AI, so this
project is rather a small hobby rather than a proper tool.

In the future probably I will add OpenAI API, which could solve this AI lack of data magnificently in the
downside of having to pay for it.
